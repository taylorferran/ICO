Here I'm learning how to create an initial coin offering using solidity/hardhat for the backend and react for the frontend.

It's deployed on the rinkeby test network and can be seen here - https://initial-coin-offering-8gpcr57l3-taylorferran.vercel.app/

If the user owns an NFT from the previous project built, they can can redeem 10 tokens per NFT they own.

After that they can buy more tokens with test eth.

This is part of the learnweb3.io course.
